# gemini-tenis

Inspiration comes from [this](https://x.com/FarzaTV/status/1928484483076087922) viral demo.

'text.json' will be the file that overlays text on top of the video
`tenis.py` is mostly just an OpenCV visualizer.

To make this a real time product I'll need to:

1) Smartly send frames to Gemini (Gemini Video can only handle 1 FPS)
2) Use Gemini API to return content.
3) Render it.
